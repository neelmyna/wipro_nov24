GIT NOTES:

Create GIT account
Create new repo 
Create personal access token(PAT)
Install git
 
use the below command to check if git is available/installed
git --version
 
the below is the repo URL (domain-name/username/repo-name)
https://github.com/VidyeshSorte/wipro_c_nov24
 
To download any local repo, use below command
git clone https://github.com/VidyeshSorte/wipro_c_nov24

To make the configurations while syncing remote repo with local repo use the below two commands(one time activity)

$ git config --global user.name "VidyeshSorte"
 
$ git config --global user.email "vidyeshsorte@gmail.com"


Template command to sync remote repo with local repo
git clone https://PAT@github.com/VidyeshSorte/wipro_c_nov24

To check the current status use below command
git status
 
To stage the changes (To mark all the files to be updated) from the pwd use the below command. The dot in the command represents current folder (pwd). This command marks all the files that need to be updated in the remote repo.
$ git add .
 
Below command creates the object that need to be moved from the local machine to the cloud(server)
$ git commit -m "relevant message"
 
Below command moves the object from the local machine to the git server. However the changes in the remote repo will be first updated to the local repo by running the command: git pull origin main
$ git push origin main
 
Bewlow command updates the changes in the remote repo to the local repo.
$ git pull origin main

Steps to Create PAT:

Top right corner, click on your profile picture
Sroll down and Click settings (left bottom corner)
Next page, scroll down and click developer settings
Next page, top right of the page, click tokens classic
Next page, click generate new token -> selct classic
Add a Note
Select Expiry: No expiry
Do no other changes any where.
Sroll down the page and click generate token
Copy the token and mail it to your self
Note: Do not save the PAT any where in your Repo folder
---------------------------------------------------
Once we have created Repo and the PAT, now we shall clone our repo:

Copy the repo URL
Add the PAT with explained template
Run the command:

$ git close repo_url_with_pat

Run the 2 config commands

Now, save the c_notex.txt inside repo folder
Now run the 3 commands to see the changes in remote repo

git add .
git commit -m "message"
git push origin main

use git status to keep watching the changes after every command.
----------------------------
Hope all participants ahve installed VS CODE
$ code
is the command to run the vs code

$ code .
is the command to run vs code in current path
------------------------------------------------------------------
C PROGRAMMING

There is no need of programming if there is no Data
There is no need of computer if there is no data.

Hence everything revolves around data.

Data:
Anything that is worth storing or remembering. Data must have implicit meaning.
IF you cannot figure out the category or domain or entity or the area under which the data is coming from, then it cannot be data.

Data can be categorised as:
1. Numeric
2. string

There are many forms of data like, audible sound, images, video etc.

Numeric:
	1. Numbers only (distinct or descrete)
	2. Numbers with precision (The decimal part of the number is to only add accuracy to the number)
string:
	1. alphabetic
	2. alphanumeric
	
Data in memory is stored in the form:
ON OFF
We see on and off as 1 and 0
Now, we can make combination of 1 and 0s and make patterns

For example, we can say
110011 as A
110001 as B
110101 as C etc,

Now, different individuals and companies may use different patterns.
How ever if they have to work together, then same pattern is required.

Problems occur when different individuals or companies are working on same project.

Hence we need a STANDARD pattern which vcan be used by majority of people or companies.

Hence, the ASCII character set was introduced.
This incluses mainly 5 parts:
1. English upper case letters
2. English lower case letters
3. The 10 digits as characters
4. important 32 symbols
5. other symbols

There are 256 ASCII characters, and every ASCII character has its own ASCII value which starts from Zero and thus ends with 255.
Hence the size of any ASCII character is One byte.

Note that in one bit, we can store any of the 2 values 0 or 1
Thus, in 2 bits we can store 4 different values.
In 3 bits, 8 different values
Thus in N bits we can store 2powerN values
Thus in N+1 bits we can store (2powerN * 2) values
Thus, with addition of one bit, the range of values we can store doubles.

1 bit:
0 1
2 bits:
00 01 10 11
3 bits:
000 001 010 011 100 101 110 111

4 bits is called as a Nibble
In one Nibble, we can store upto 16 different values.
Base-2 are called as Binary numbers
Base-8 are called as Octal numbers
Base-10 are called as Decimal numbers
Base-16 are called as Hexa-Decimal numbers

So in one Niblle we can store 1111 which is 15 which is in Hexa-Decimal is 'f' or 'F'

Thus ff = 15 * 16power1 + 15 * 16power0 = 16*15 + 15*1 = 240 + 15 = 255
567 as decimal number = 5 * 10power2 + 6 * 10power1 + 7 * 10power0 = 5*100 + 6*10 + 7*1 = 500 + 60 + 7 = 567

EVOLUTION OF PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES

Special Characters called as ESCAPE SEQUENCES:
\n		new line character (line break) ASCII value is 32
\t		horizontal tab
\v		vertical tab
\b		back space
\a		audible system notification
\\		to print \
\"		to print "
\r		carriage return

DATA TYPES:
Since much of the data are similar or can be categorized, we have the following basic or primitive DTs in C, namely:
char	1 byte		Accepts any of the ASCII characters
int		4 bytes		4 bytes of integer number (by default int is signed int). By default int is long int
double	8 bytes		Number with precision
float	4 bytes		A small Number with precion
Note: The precision is usually of 6 digits by default. However, we can store more accuracy.

MANIPULATORS of DTs:
	1. Size manipulator: short and long
short can be applied only to int and short int is 2 bytes
long can also be applied only to int and long long int is 8 bytes
	2. Sign Manipulator: By default all number of all DTs have sign. Thus the MSB or LSB (depending on how numbers are stored using either Little Endian or Big Endian) is used as Sign bit.
	If the MSB is 1 (set) then the number is -ve
	If the MSB is Zero (not set) then the number is +ve
