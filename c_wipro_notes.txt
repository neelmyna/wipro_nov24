GIT NOTES:

Create GIT account
Create new repo 
Create personal access token(PAT)
Install git
 
use the below command to check if git is available/installed
git --version
 
the below is the repo URL (domain-name/username/repo-name)
https://github.com/VidyeshSorte/wipro_c_nov24
 
To download any local repo, use below command
git clone https://github.com/VidyeshSorte/wipro_c_nov24

To make the configurations while syncing remote repo with local repo use the below two commands(one time activity)

$ git config --global user.name "VidyeshSorte"
 
$ git config --global user.email "vidyeshsorte@gmail.com"


Template command to sync remote repo with local repo
git clone https://PAT@github.com/VidyeshSorte/wipro_c_nov24

To check the current status use below command
git status
 
To stage the changes (To mark all the files to be updated) from the pwd use the below command. The dot in the command represents current folder (pwd). This command marks all the files that need to be updated in the remote repo.
$ git add .
 
Below command creates the object that need to be moved from the local machine to the cloud(server)
$ git commit -m "relevant message"
 
Below command moves the object from the local machine to the git server. However the changes in the remote repo will be first updated to the local repo by running the command: git pull origin main
$ git push origin main
 
Bewlow command updates the changes in the remote repo to the local repo.
$ git pull origin main

Steps to Create PAT:

Top right corner, click on your profile picture
Sroll down and Click settings (left bottom corner)
Next page, scroll down and click developer settings
Next page, top right of the page, click tokens classic
Next page, click generate new token -> selct classic
Add a Note
Select Expiry: No expiry
Do no other changes any where.
Sroll down the page and click generate token
Copy the token and mail it to your self
Note: Do not save the PAT any where in your Repo folder
---------------------------------------------------
Once we have created Repo and the PAT, now we shall clone our repo:

Copy the repo URL
Add the PAT with explained template
Run the command:

$ git close repo_url_with_pat

Run the 2 config commands

Now, save the c_notex.txt inside repo folder
Now run the 3 commands to see the changes in remote repo

git add .
git commit -m "message"
git push origin main

use git status to keep watching the changes after every command.
----------------------------
Hope all participants ahve installed VS CODE
$ code
is the command to run the vs code

$ code .
is the command to run vs code in current path

C PROGRAMMING

There is no need of programming if there is no Data
There is no need of computer if there is no data.

Hence everything revolves around data.

Data:
Anything that is worth storing or remembering. Data must have implicit meaning.
IF you cannot figure out the category or domain or entity or the area under which the data is coming from, then it cannot be data.

Data can be categorised as:
1. Numeric
2. string

There are many forms of data like, audible sound, images, video etc.

Numeric:
	1. Numbers only (distinct or descrete)
	2. Numbers with precision (The decimal part of the number is to only add accuracy to the number)
string:
	1. alphabetic
	2. alphanumeric
	
Data in memory is stored in the form:
ON OFF
We see on and off as 1 and 0
Now, we can make combination of 1 and 0s and make patterns

For example, we can say
110011 as A
110001 as B
110101 as C etc,

Now, different individuals and companies may use different patterns.
How ever if they have to work together, then same pattern is required.

Problems occur when different individuals or companies are working on same project.

Hence we need a STANDARD pattern which vcan be used by majority of people or companies.

Hence, the ASCII character set was introduced.
This incluses mainly 5 parts:
1. English upper case letters
2. English lower case letters
3. The 10 digits as characters
4. important 32 symbols
5. other symbols

There are 256 ASCII characters, and every ASCII character has its own ASCII value which starts from Zero and thus ends with 255.
Hence the size of any ASCII character is One byte.

Note that in one bit, we can store any of the 2 values 0 or 1
Thus, in 2 bits we can store 4 different values.
In 3 bits, 8 different values
Thus in N bits we can store 2powerN values
Thus in N+1 bits we can store (2powerN * 2) values
Thus, with addition of one bit, the range of values we can store doubles.

1 bit:
0 1
2 bits:
00 01 10 11
3 bits:
000 001 010 011 100 101 110 111

4 bits is called as a Nibble
In one Nibble, we can store upto 16 different values.
Base-2 are called as Binary numbers
Base-8 are called as Octal numbers
Base-10 are called as Decimal numbers
Base-16 are called as Hexa-Decimal numbers

So in one Niblle we can store 1111 which is 15 which is in Hexa-Decimal is 'f' or 'F'

Thus ff = 15 * 16power1 + 15 * 16power0 = 16*15 + 15*1 = 240 + 15 = 255
567 as decimal number = 5 * 10power2 + 6 * 10power1 + 7 * 10power0 = 5*100 + 6*10 + 7*1 = 500 + 60 + 7 = 567

Pending Topic:
EVOLUTION OF PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES

Special Characters called as ESCAPE SEQUENCES:
\n		new line character (line break) ASCII value is 32
\t		horizontal tab
\v		vertical tab
\b		back space
\a		audible system notification
\\		to print \
\"		to print "
\r		carriage return
\0		end of string character

DATA TYPES:
Since much of the data are similar or can be categorized, we have the following basic or primitive DTs in C, namely:
char	1 byte		Accepts any of the ASCII characters
int		4 bytes		4 bytes of integer number (by default int is signed int). By default int is long int
double	8 bytes		Number with precision
float	4 bytes		A small Number with precion
Note: The precision is usually of 6 digits by default. However, we can store more accuracy.

MANIPULATORS of DTs:
	1. Size manipulator: short and long
short can be applied only to int and short int is 2 bytes
long can also be applied only to int and long long int is 8 bytes
	2. Sign Manipulator: By default all number of all DTs have sign. Thus the MSB or LSB (depending on how numbers are stored using either Little Endian or Big Endian) is used as Sign bit.
	If the MSB is 1 (set) then the number is -ve
	If the MSB is Zero (not set) then the number is +ve

I/O Functions:
library: stdio.h
.h file is header file
All header files will have only function declarations (prototypes)
Their respective .c files will have the definitions (implementations)
Prototype of a function will have 3 things. Return type, function name and the argument list.

C is a procedural programming language (PPL)
Thus for everything and anything, we have to do/solve it in terms of functions.
PPL follows Divide and Conquer Technique
Given a big problem, we divide it into N number of sub problems which are Atomic in nature and we solve each of these sub problems using one function.
Synonyms of for Function: methods, procedure, behaviour.

C is also Modular language.
That is, related code or functions are grouped
For example, all string handling functions are put into string.h
All mathematical functions are put into math.h
All I/P functions are put into stdio.h and so on
Like wise we too (programmers) group the related functions into a files.

I/P Functions:

Note:
stdin refers to standard input device
stdout refers to standard o/p device
stderr refers to standard error device usually stdout itself

getc(): used to read one character from stdin or from file
int getc(FILE *stream); // Prototype
char ch = getc(stdin);  // Example

putc(): used to write one character to the stdout or to file
int putc(char, FILE*);
putc(ch, stdout);

gets(): used to read a string (space is also part of the i/p)

puts(): used to write a string
printf(): used to write a formatted string
scanf(): used to read formatted string
sprintf(): used to read a string from memory format it and store it back in memory (some other variable or same variable)
sscanf(): Similar to sprintf()
fprintf(): Used to write formatted string to file
fscanf(): used to read formatter string from file

FORMAT SPECIFIERS:
%c		to print any of the 256 ASCII chars					1 byte
%d		to print int number in decimal format				4 bytes
%o		to print int number in octal format					4 bytes
%x %X   to print int number in hexa-decimal format	4 or 	8 bytes
%u		to print unsigned int number in decimal format		4 bytes
%p		to print an address									4 bytes
%s		to print a string (set of characters which is one data. String must end with end of string character which is \0 character)
%f		to print float data									4 bytes
%lf		to print double data								8 bytes
%ld		to print long long int in decimal format			8 bytes

Operators
Output Formatting
Type Casting
Conditional programming
Ternary Operator
Switch case
Loops
Nested Loops
Function call Stack

OPERATORS:
Arithmetic Operators: + - / % *

num1 + num2
values/numbers/input/operands

1. All Arithmetic operators take 2 operands (All are Binary operators)
2. The operator is placed in-between the operands (Infix notation)
num1 num2 + Postfix notation
+ num1 num2 Prefix  notation
3. Input are numbers and output is also a number
4. Some operators have lesser precedence (+ - have less precedence than * / %)

result = num1 + num2 * num3
Here the multiplication is performed 1st (Broadmas rule)

5. In the below statement, num1 - num2 is performed 1st. Thus all Arithmetic operations are performed from left to Right (Associtivity)
result = num1 - num2 + num3

6. 45 + 5.5

num1 = 45
num2 = -9
sum = num1 + num2

The operations can be performed only if the type of data of the operands are same.

Note:
0.0 is double which is of 8 bytes
0.0f is float which is of 4 bytes

How Negative numbers are stored in memory:

int num = -23; // Signed integer
signed int num = -23;
signed long int num = -23; // MSB bit will be dedicated to store sign of the number.
If MSB is 1 then the number is -ve. If MSB is 0 then the number is +ve

-23
23  (absolute of -23)
10111

0001 0111
1110 1000
        1
1110 1001

-1 * 2(7) + 1 * 2(6) + 1 * 2(5) + 9
= -128 + 64 + 32 + 9
= -64 + 41
= -23

-ve numbers are stored in memory using 2's compliment technique.

RELATIONAL OPERATORS: > < >= <= != ==
1. All are binary operators
2. Used with Infix notation
3. All relational operators have lesser precedence than arithmetic operators but they have higher precedence than logical operators
4. I/P are numbers. O/P is Boolean
5. Left to Right associtivity

45 > 7  	true	1
45 != 45 	false	0
45 >= 40			1
45 > 39 is same as 45 >= 40
n <= 20 is same as n < 21

In the above 2 statements, each of the statements are same.
That is, what ever we write using >= or <= can be written using > and <
Thus, it looks as if >= and <= are redundant.

[10, 20] is closed interval. where both end values are included
(20, 40) is open interval. Here the range is 21 to 39 (end values not included)
[30, 50) Right open. Range is 30 to 49

n >= 10 and n <= 20           n > 9 and n < 21
n > 20 and n < 40
n >= 30 and n < 50

LOGICAL OPERATORS: & && | || !

C1 & C2 & C3  	Here all conditions are always checked
C1 && C2 && C3	Here if the C1 fails, then remaining conditions are not checked

! is unary operator. All unary operators are to be used before the operand.
In C, there is no bool DT. Hence true is implecitly converted to 1 and false to 0.
Also note that all non-zero values incuding -ve numbers are treated as true and only zero is treated as false.

I/P to logical operators is  truth values (boolean)
O/P is also boolean

Updation Operators: ++ --
increment and decrement
Both of these operators have 2 behaviour. Infix and Postfix

Bitwise Operators: & | ^ ~ >> <<

0 0 0 1 0 1 1 1  X
0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0  Y

0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0  &   4

0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1  |  31

0 0 0 1 1 0 1 1  ^  27

1 1 1 1 0 0 1 1  ~Y
-128 + 64 + 32 + 16 + 3 = -64 + 51 = -13


1   1   0   1   1
4   3   2   1   0 power 2

X >> 3
0 0 0 1 0 1 1 1  
0 0 0 0 1 0 1 1
0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1
0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0  2

Y << 2           
0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0  Y =  8
0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0  Y = 16
0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0  Y = 32
