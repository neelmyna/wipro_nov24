FARMER PROBLEM STATEMENT

Mahesh is a farmer and owns 80 acres of land. His land is equally divided into 5 segments. He grows tomatoes in the 1st segment, potatoes in the 2nd segment, cabbage in the 3rd segment, sunflower in the 4th segment and sugarcane in the 5th segment.
He is converting his land from chemical-driven farming to chemical-free farming. Mahesh starts with the conversion of vegetables into chemical-free produce. He spends the first 6 months doing the same.
He then converts the sunflower land bank into chemical-free farming. This takes him another 4 months. Finally, he converts sugarcane into chemical-free farming over the next 4 months.
He gets a yield of the following for tomatoes. 30% of his tomato land gives him 10 tonne yield per acre.
The remaining 70% of his tomato land gives him 12 tonnes yield per acre.
The selling price of tomato is Rs. 7 per Kg.
The yield of potatoes is 10 tonnes per acre. He sells each kg at Rs. 20.
The yield of cabbage is 14 tonnes per acre. He sells each kg at Rs. 24.
The yield of sunflowers is 0.7 tonnes per acre. He sells each kg at Rs. 200.
The yield of sugarcane is 45 tonnes per acre. He sells each tonne at Rs. 4,000.
All the crops are sowed at the same time. Mahesh gets the above yield at the above-mentioned rate in one crop cycle across his entire land of 80 acres.
What is
a. The overall sales achieved by Mahesh from the 80 acres of land.
b. Sales realisation from chemical-free farming at the end of 11 months?

total_land = 80
no_of_segments = 5
each_segment = total_land // no_of_segments

tamoto_yield_tonnes = (each_segment * 0.3 * 10) + (each_segment * 0.7 *12)
tomato_sales_amount = int(tamoto_yield_tonnes * 1000 * 7)

potato_yeild_tonnes = each_segment * 10
potato_sales_amount = potato_yeild_tonnes * 1000 * 20

cabbage_yeild_tonnes = each_segment * 14
cabbage_sales_amount = cabbage_yeild_tonnes * 1000 * 24

sunflower_yeild_tonnes = each_segment * 0.7
sunflower_sales_amount = int(sunflower_yeild_tonnes * 1000 * 200)

sugarcane_yeild_tonnes = each_segment * 45
sugarcane_sales_amount = sugarcane_yeild_tonnes * 4000

total_sales_amount = tomato_sales_amount + potato_sales_amount + sunflower_sales_amount + sugarcane_sales_amount

Why an un initialized pointer is called as wild pointer ?

float fArray[] = {2.2f, 4.4f, 1.5f, 9.1f, 6.75f};

print these:

fArray, fArray+1, fArray-1, fArray+2
// All of these are addresses


*fArray, *fArray+1, *fArray + *fArray
// All of these are values


&fArray, &fArray+1, &fArray-1, &fArray+2
// All of these are addresses
---------------------------------------------------------------------

* An Array is a variable of variables.
* The need of an Array arose to overcome the problem of
maintaining too many variable names.
* In an Array all the elements are of same DT and same size.
* In java, an Array is an Object.
* Size of an Array must be fixed at the time of declaration.
* Size of an Array is always fixed and it cannot ever be changed.
* To access/reach an element in an Array, we use the INDEX
within the subscript.
* Index of any Array starts with Zero and ends with n-1 where
n is size of the Array.
* An Array is a DS. (Linear)
* An Array is Memory IN-EFFICIENT DS.
* Time taken to access any element in an Array is same.
i.e. O(1) (one unit of time). Hence an Array is Time Efficient DS

Strings

A string is a data
A string is made up of one or more characters
A string can be roughly devided into 2:
	Alphabetic
	Alphanumeric

All the characters of a string together make-up one data
For example, "Ayodhya"

This data is a place name. Thus all the 7 characters of it together is one data.
To store one character, we need one character variable.
Thus to store "Ayodhya" we need 7 character variables.

char ch1 = 'A', ch2 = 'y', ch3 = 'o', ch4 = 'd', ch5 = 'h', ch6 = 'y', ch7 = 'a';

Now, we have store one data in 7 variables.
If we wish to send this one data to a function, then we must send 7 args.

However, passing one Arg as one data is good.
Hence We must save these 7 characters which are closely related together in one variable.
Hence we use charcater arrays to store string data.

char placeName1[] = "Ayodhya";
Here we have stored the data as one data and not 7 data.
Also the string data has one implicit property when it is stored as a string in an array. That is, the excape sequence (null character) '\0' is stored as "end of string" character always.

char placeName2[] = {'A', 'y', 'o', 'd', 'h' 'y', 'a'};
Here the '\0' will not be stored at the end.

Thus, the sizeof placeName1 is 8 characters in memory.
And, the sizeof placeName2 is 7 character in memory.

Way to initialize a string:
char userString1[32] = ""; // empty string
char userString2[32] = { '\0' }; // empty string
char userString3[] = "Ayodhya"; 
char userString4[] = {'A', 'y', 'o', 'd', 'h' 'y', 'a', '\0'};

STRING HANDLING FUNCTIONS:

strlen()
It is used to find length of a string
Prototype:
int strlen(const char*);
size_t strlen(const char*);

strcpy()
It is used to copy a string into another
Prototype:
char* strcpy(char*, const char*);
Usage: strcpy(destination, source);
strcpy() returns the address of the destination string

strcat()
It is used to append/concatinate a string to other
Prototype:
char* strcat(char*, const char*);
Usage: strcat(destination, source);
strcat() returns the address of the destination string
Note that, the source string is copied from end of the destination.
Hence to concatinate the string, we must 1st find length of the destination string.

strrev()
It is used to reverse a string
char* strrev(char*)
It returns address of the o/p string which happens to be the i/p array itself

strchr()
It finds address of 1st occurance of the character in the string
char* strchr(const char*, char)
It returns the address of the 1st occurance of the given character in the string. If not found, it return NULL

strrchr()
It finds address of last occurance of the character in the string
char* strrchr(const char*, char)
It returns the address of the last occurance of the given character in the string. If not found, it return NULL
To do this, the function starts the search from the end.
Hence strrchr() 1st uses strlen()

strcmp()
It (case sensitive) compares two strings and returns an int value
0 means the strings are same
-1 means the 1st string is smaller than the 2nd
1 meams the 2nd string is smaller than the 1st
Note that, smaller we mean, where the difference of ASCII characters of the unmatching characters of the string
Prototype:
int strcmp(const char*, const char*)

stricmp()
It (case in-sensitive) compares two strings and returns an int value
0 means the strings are same
-1 means the 1st string is smaller than the 2nd
1 meams the 2nd string is smaller than the 1st
Note that, smaller we mean, where the difference of ASCII characters of the unmatching characters of the string
Prototype:
int stricmp(const char*, const char*)

strncmp()
It (case sensitive) compares two strings for 1st n characters only and returns an int value
0 means the strings are same
-1 means the 1st string is smaller than the 2nd
1 meams the 2nd string is smaller than the 1st
Note that, smaller we mean, where the difference of ASCII characters of the unmatching characters of the string
Prototype:
int strncmp(const char*, const char*, int)

strstr()
To check if a sub string is present in the given string
It returns the address where the sub string is found, else NULL
Prototype:
char* strstr(const char* mainString, char* subString);

strtok()

Programs on strings
2D array example on strings
function pointer
structure (definition, array of structures, nested, padding, bit fields, pointer to a structure, function pointer inside a structure, SRS)
Bit manupalation
DMA (malloc, calloc)
Dynamic Array
Styack and Queue implementation
Linked Lists

3D String Example:
1. Store first name and last name of the last 5 presidents of Bhaarat

2D String Example:
Accept the strings from command line as given:
"karnataka bengaluru" "odhisa bhubaneswar" "sikkim gangtok" "tripura agartala" "goa panjim"

You can take any number of strings as you wish.
Each string is made up of state-capital pair which is seperated by space

Now, create 2 2D char arrays
states[10][32];
capitals[10][32];

Now seperate the states and capitals and store them in the given 2 arrays and print them with proper formatting.


"goa panjim"
Find the address of space (ADDRESS)
Now find number of characters in the state (COUNT)
now copy the state part of the string from args[i] to states[i]
now copy the capital part of the string to capitals[i]

addressOfSpace = strchr(args[i], ' ');
now take int variable = address of space - address of 1st element
count = addressOfSpace - args[i];
strncpy(states[i], args[i], count);
---------------------------------------------
FUNCTION POINTER

As we have pointer that points to a variable (or another pointer which is also a variable), we can also have pointer pointing to a function.

A pointer of type float* can point to any variable in the function/program of type float.

Thus, we know that variables ahev data type.

And functions have prototypes.
Thus a pointer of a specific prototype can point to any function with that particular prototype.
----------------------------------------------------
DYNAMIC MEMORY ALLOCATION

All the variables we have declared so far in all our programs, will be created as soon as the control goes to the declartive statement.

example: int num1, num2, num3;
Here these 3 variables will be created when control goes there during runtime and nobody can stop it nor we can modify the size or data type or number of variables.

Example2:
flost studentAverageScores[50];

Here the programmer has defined this statement.
Hence the programmer is assumming that there might be 50 students whose average scores need to be stored.

However, it is the users/customers/client who knows the number of students.

Now, if the user stores only 10 scores then 40 variables/elements of the array are wasted.
In another case when the user wants to store 80 scores, then there will be shortage of 30 variables.

So it is good if the user can decide the size of the array.
However, the user comes into picture during runtime only.
And during runtime, it is impossible to change/modify the program code.
Hence we need a new way to decide the amount of memory to be allocated during runtime.
And this mechanism is called as DYNAMIC (RUNTIME) MEMORY ALLOCATION.

We know C is a procedural language and hence to achieve this, we have 3 functions available from stdlib.h

malloc()
calloc()
realloc()
free()

malloc():
It takes the number of bytes as argument and it allocates memory in Heap. And it returns the address of 1st byte.
***Note: malloc() returns an address. This means in the code, there must a pointer to receive this address.
The pointer is a variable.
And all variables have their DT

malloc() is used to allocate memory to store data of any DT including user defined DTs
Hence the address which malloc returns is a GENERIC ADDRESS.
A generic address is one whose DT is not yet assertained.
Thus the prototype of malloc is:

void* malloc(int);
More correctly it is,
void* malloc(size_t);

*** Note that the memory allocated in Heap area, does not carry a name. It must be accessed only via its address.

*** Note that, the memory allocated in the Heap, must be deallocated using free(). The memory deallocation from Heap is not Storage class dependent.
